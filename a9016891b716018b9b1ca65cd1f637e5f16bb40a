So, in light of this, IMO this current solution will work better than having the plain password in secure.config. Please provide your opinion aspect. :)",

As this is the most demanded and most awaited feature in its-jira, it might be worth having to create branches and include this feature.\n\nForgive me If I my understanding is not correct, usually the stable branches are not changed much right except the bug fixes or other minor changes to keep that version working. If this is true, then we will not have much of a problem with different branches.\n\nWaiting for a positive response. :)",
